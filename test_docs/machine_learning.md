# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data. The model makes predictions based on input features and is corrected when wrong.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and relationships in the data without guidance.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent that learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Applications

Machine learning is used in:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
