# Cooking Basics

Cooking is the art and science of preparing food for consumption.

## Essential Techniques

### Sautéing
Sautéing involves cooking food quickly in a small amount of fat over high heat. It's great for vegetables and thin cuts of meat.

### Braising
Braising is a slow-cooking method that combines dry and wet heat. First sear the food, then cook slowly in liquid.

### Roasting
Roasting uses dry heat in an oven to cook food evenly. It's ideal for meats and vegetables.
