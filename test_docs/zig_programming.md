# Zig Programming Language

Zig is a systems programming language designed for robustness and performance.

## Key Features

### Memory Safety
Zig provides memory safety without hidden control flow or garbage collection. It catches undefined behavior at compile time when possible.

### C Interoperability
Zig can import C header files and call C functions directly. This makes it easy to integrate with existing C codebases.

### Compile-Time Execution
Zig's comptime feature allows code to be executed at compile time, enabling powerful metaprogramming capabilities.

## Why Use Zig?

- No hidden allocations
- Clear error handling with error unions
- Built-in testing support
- Cross-compilation support
- Readable generated assembly
